# **Privacy Policy**

## **Last Modified October 2025**


Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use (located at \[<span class="mark">link</span>\]) (together, the “Policy”), and capitalized terms used herein have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use. 

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions, or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means of posting a notification on this site or by other means if required by law. We may make non-substantive updates or clarify existing provisions without notifying you. It is your responsibility to review this site and this Privacy Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the site after such modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified Privacy Policy and you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

1. <ins>**The Information We Collect; How We Collect Information**.</ins> 

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
1.1 We will collect certain information from you that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked to, a particular person or household, such as your name, email address, and date of birth (collectively “Personal Information”). We collect Personal Information from you when you provide it to us, such as when you make an Account.

1.2 To use the Application effectively, you will be asked to provide certain information, other than Personal Information, that may be unique to your experiences, habits, and preferences (the “Quiz Content”). We will use Quiz Content to create quizzes within the Application, which will be shared with and visible to other Users participating in your quiz session (the “Players”). The nature of the quizzes is such that Players will have the ability to associate Quiz Content with you by participating in the quiz session. The extent to which you share Quiz Content, and therefore to which Quiz Content is shared with and visible to Players, is within your sole discretion, and at any time you may respond with “N/A” or any other indication that you prefer not to provide Quiz Content when prompted within the Application. By providing Quiz Content, however, you thereby consent to our use of the Quiz Content during the respective quiz session, and to share the same with Players.

1.3 We may also collect information regarding how the Services are accessed and used by you, including but not limited to your access times, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and/or the time spent on those pages (collectively, “Usage Data”). Usage Data is collected for every User of the Application. We may associate Usage Data with a unique identifier or with other information about you in our internal systems. Usage Data may be collected automatically as you navigate through the Application, and we may also engage third party service providers to obtain Usage Data on our behalf, subject to their own policies.

1.4 If you access any Services for which we require payment, and then navigate to or are directed to a Payment Processor website or application to complete your payment, we may work with such Payment Processor to confirm whether or not you completed the payment, and we may provide such information that may be necessary to enable you to complete your payment. The Payment Processor may provide us with a unique identifier, and/or we may employ certain tracking methods, that will enable us to re-associate the information about your payment or potential payment with your Account on the Application. For the avoidance of doubt, a Payment Processor may collect personally-identifiable information about you subject to its own policies when you navigate a Payment Processor's site, create an account on that site, and/or make a payment through that site; you should review each Payment Processor's policies and practices related to the personally-identifiable information you provide directly to a Payment Processor.
